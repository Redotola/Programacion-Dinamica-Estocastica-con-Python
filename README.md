# Programacion-Dinamica-Estocastica-con-Python

# Objectives

    - Learn how to use the dinamic programming and their benefits
    - Understanding the differences between deterministic and non-deterministic programs
    - Learn estotastic programming and how to use it
    - Learn to create valid computer simulations

# Memorization 

The memorization is a technique to store previous information to avoid process information
again

Normally use a dictionary, where the consults are made in O(1).

Exchange time for space

# Aleatory paths

It's a type of simulation that choose aleatory from a desicion set

It's used in many different fields when the system is not deterministic and includes aleatory elements

# Stochastic programming

A program that is deterministic if when the input produce the same output

The deterministic programs are very important, but exist programs that can't be resolved with 
that way

The stochastic programming allows introduction to aleatory in our programs to create simulations
that allow solve other kinds of problems

# Stadistic Inference

With the simulations we can calculate the probabilities of complex events knowin the probabilities of simple events

The stadistic inference techniques allow us infer the properties of a poblation from a random sample
